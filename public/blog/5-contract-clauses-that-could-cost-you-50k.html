<h1>5 Contract Clauses That Could Cost You $50,000</h1>
<p>Every year, freelancers, renters, and startup founders sign contracts with clauses that could drain their bank accounts. A lawyer would charge $300/hour to catch these — but you can spot them in 60 seconds with the right knowledge (or the right tool).</p>
<p>Here are the 5 most dangerous clauses we see in contracts analyzed on BriefPulse:</p>

<div class="clause-card">
<h3>1. Unlimited Liability</h3>
<div class="cost">💰 Potential cost: $10,000 – $500,000+</div>
<p>This clause means there's <strong>no cap</strong> on how much you could owe if something goes wrong. If your client's business loses revenue and blames your work, you could be liable for their entire loss.</p>
<div class="example">"Contractor shall be liable for all damages, losses, and expenses arising from the performance of services, without limitation."</div>
<div class="fix">✅ <strong>Fix:</strong> Negotiate a liability cap — typically 1-2x the contract value. "Total liability shall not exceed the fees paid under this agreement."</div>
</div>

<div class="clause-card">
<h3>2. Overbroad Non-Compete</h3>
<div class="cost">💰 Potential cost: $50,000+ in lost income</div>
<p>Some non-competes prevent you from working in your <strong>entire industry</strong> for 1-2 years after the contract ends. As a freelancer, this could mean zero income for months.</p>
<div class="example">"Contractor agrees not to provide similar services to any competing business within the United States for a period of 24 months following termination."</div>
<div class="fix">✅ <strong>Fix:</strong> Narrow the scope. Limit to direct competitors, specific geographic area, and 3-6 months max.</div>
</div>

<div class="clause-card">
<h3>3. Blanket IP Assignment</h3>
<div class="cost">💰 Potential cost: Your entire portfolio + future work</div>
<p>This clause transfers ownership of <strong>everything you create</strong> — not just project deliverables, but potentially your side projects, tools, and pre-existing work.</p>
<div class="example">"All work product, inventions, and intellectual property created by Contractor during the term of this agreement shall be the exclusive property of Company."</div>
<div class="fix">✅ <strong>Fix:</strong> Limit IP assignment to deliverables specifically created for this project. Exclude pre-existing IP and work outside scope.</div>
</div>

<div class="clause-card">
<h3>4. Unilateral Termination Without Pay</h3>
<div class="cost">💰 Potential cost: Months of unpaid work</div>
<p>Some contracts let the client terminate at any time <strong>without paying for work already completed</strong>. You could do 3 months of work and walk away with nothing.</p>
<div class="example">"Company may terminate this agreement at any time for any reason. Upon termination, no further payments shall be due."</div>
<div class="fix">✅ <strong>Fix:</strong> Add a "kill fee" clause: payment for all work completed to date, plus 30 days notice required.</div>
</div>

<div class="clause-card">
<h3>5. Personal Guarantee in Business Contracts</h3>
<div class="cost">💰 Potential cost: Your house, car, savings</div>
<p>If you signed a contract through your LLC but it includes a personal guarantee, <strong>your personal assets are at risk</strong>. The entire point of an LLC is gone.</p>
<div class="example">"Principal personally guarantees all obligations of the business entity under this agreement."</div>
<div class="fix">✅ <strong>Fix:</strong> Strike the personal guarantee entirely, or limit it to a specific dollar amount far below your personal assets.</div>
</div>

<h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>
<p><strong>Read every contract before signing.</strong> Sounds obvious, but most people don't. The average NDA is 2,500 words — that's 10 minutes of reading, but most people sign in under 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Use a contract analyzer.</strong> Tools like <a href="/" style="color:#7c5cfc">BriefPulse</a> scan contracts clause-by-clause, flag risks in plain English, and suggest specific negotiation language. It's what a $300/hour lawyer does, for free.</p>
<p><strong>Always negotiate.</strong> Contracts are not take-it-or-leave-it. 73% of freelancers who negotiate get better terms. The other party <em>expects</em> you to push back.</p>
