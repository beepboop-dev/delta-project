<h1>How to Review an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) — Free Guide 2026</h1>

<p>Non-disclosure agreements are everywhere. Before a job interview, a freelance project, a business partnership, or even a product demo — someone slides an NDA across the table. Most people sign without reading. Here's how to actually review one.</p>

<h2>What Is an NDA?</h2>
<p>A Non-Disclosure Agreement (also called a confidentiality agreement) is a legal contract that restricts what information you can share. It creates a legally binding obligation to keep certain information secret.</p>

<h2>The 7 Key Sections of Every NDA</h2>
<h3>1. Definition of Confidential Information</h3>
<p>This is the most important section. It defines what you can't share. Look for overly broad definitions like "all information" or "any materials." A good NDA specifically describes what's confidential.</p>
<div class="red-flag">🚩 <strong>Red Flag:</strong> "All information disclosed by Company, whether oral, written, or otherwise" — this is too broad. Everything becomes a secret.</div>
<div class="tip">✅ <strong>Good NDA:</strong> "Confidential Information means the source code for Project X, customer lists, and financial projections shared during the engagement period."</div>

<h3>2. Duration</h3>
<p>How long must you keep the information secret? Typical NDAs range from 1-5 years. Be wary of perpetual/indefinite NDAs.</p>
<div class="red-flag">🚩 <strong>Red Flag:</strong> "in perpetuity" or "indefinitely" — you'd be bound forever.</div>

<h3>3. Obligations</h3>
<p>What must you do to protect the information? Reasonable obligations include "use reasonable care" or "treat with the same care as your own confidential information."</p>

<h3>4. Exclusions</h3>
<p>Standard exclusions should include: information already public, information you already knew, information received from third parties, and information independently developed.</p>
<div class="red-flag">🚩 <strong>Red Flag:</strong> No exclusions at all — this means you could be liable for "leaking" publicly available information.</div>

<h3>5. Permitted Disclosures</h3>
<p>Can you share with your lawyer? Your accountant? Employees? Make sure you have reasonable rights to share with people who need to know.</p>

<h3>6. Return/Destruction of Information</h3>
<p>What happens when the NDA ends? You may need to return or destroy all confidential materials.</p>

<h3>7. Remedies</h3>
<p>What happens if you breach? Watch for "injunctive relief" (they can get a court order immediately) and "liquidated damages" (predetermined penalty amounts).</p>

<h2>5 NDA Red Flags to Never Ignore</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Non-mutual NDA</strong> — Only you are bound, not them. Always push for mutual NDAs.</li>
<li><strong>Overly broad definition</strong> — "All information" instead of specific categories.</li>
<li><strong>No exclusions</strong> — You should always have carve-outs for public info and prior knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Perpetual duration</strong> — 2-3 years is standard. Forever is not.</li>
<li><strong>Non-disparagement buried in NDA</strong> — Some NDAs sneak in clauses preventing you from saying anything negative.</li>
</ol>

<li>Add standard exclusions if missing</li>
<li>Set a reasonable time limit (2-3 years)</li>
<li>Remove any non-disparagement or non-compete language</li>
<li>Ensure you can share with your advisors</li>
</ul>
