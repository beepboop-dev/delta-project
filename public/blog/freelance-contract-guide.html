<h1>Freelance Contract Review Guide — Protect Yourself in 2026</h1>

<p>As a freelancer, contracts are your lifeline. They protect your payment, define your work, and set boundaries. But a bad contract can cost you thousands, steal your IP, or lock you out of future work. Here are the 10 clauses you must check every time.</p>

<h2>The 10-Point Freelance Contract Checklist</h2>

<h3>1. Scope of Work</h3>
<p>The most important clause. It should clearly define what you're delivering, how many revisions are included, and what's NOT included (scope creep protection).</p>
<div class="red-flag">🚩 <strong>Red Flag:</strong> Vague scope like "design services as needed" — this is an open invitation for unlimited work.</div>
<div class="tip">✅ <strong>Better:</strong> "Design 5 social media templates (1080x1080px) with 2 rounds of revisions. Additional revisions at $X/hour."</div>

<h3>2. Payment Terms</h3>
<p>When do you get paid? How? What about late payments?</p>
<ul>
<li>Always get a deposit (25-50% upfront is standard)</li>
<li>Net-15 or Net-30 max (avoid Net-60+)</li>
<li>Include late payment penalties (1.5%/month is standard)</li>
<li>Specify currency and payment method</li>
</ul>
<div class="red-flag">🚩 <strong>Red Flag:</strong> "Payment upon project completion" with no milestones — you could work for months with no pay.</div>

<h3>3. Kill Fee / Cancellation Clause</h3>
<p>What happens if they cancel mid-project? You should be compensated for work already done, plus a cancellation fee (typically 25-50% of remaining value).</p>

<h3>4. Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>This is where freelancers get burned the most. Common approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>License:</strong> You keep ownership, they get usage rights (best for freelancers)</li>
<li><strong>Transfer on payment:</strong> IP transfers when you're fully paid (good compromise)</li>
<li><strong>Work for hire:</strong> They own everything from the start (worst for freelancers)</li>
</ul>
<div class="red-flag">🚩 <strong>Red Flag:</strong> "All work product, including preliminary drafts, is work made for hire" — you can't even use it in your portfolio.</div>

<h3>5. Non-Compete Clause</h3>
<p>Some clients try to prevent you from working with competitors. As a freelancer, this can devastate your business.</p>
<div class="red-flag">🚩 <strong>Red Flag:</strong> Any non-compete lasting more than 6 months or covering a broad industry.</div>

<h3>6. Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Reasonable confidentiality is fine. Overbroad confidentiality that prevents you from mentioning you worked with the client is not.</p>

<h3>7. Liability Cap</h3>
<p>Your liability should be capped at the amount they paid you. Never accept unlimited liability.</p>

<h3>8. Revision Limits</h3>
<p>Unlimited revisions = unlimited free work. Always specify a number (2-3 rounds is standard) with additional revisions billed hourly.</p>

<h3>9. Termination Clause</h3>
<p>Both parties should be able to terminate with reasonable notice (14-30 days). Ensure you're paid for work completed.</p>

<h3>10. Portfolio Rights</h3>
<p>Make sure you can show the work in your portfolio. If there's a confidentiality clause, carve out an exception for portfolio use.</p>

<li>No non-compete (or very narrow one)</li>
<li>Confidentiality doesn't prevent portfolio use</li>
<li>Liability is capped at project value</li>
<li>Revisions are limited (2-3 rounds)</li>
